Here are the highlighted points you will learn in the specialization, along with their definitions:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A field that allows computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.
2. **Classification and Vector Spaces**: The process of distinguishing between pieces of text based on sentiment (positive or negative) using algorithms like logistic regression and naive Bayes classifiers. It also includes representing words, queries, and documents as numerical vectors.
3. **Locality Sensitive Hashing**: A method for efficient search in high-dimensional spaces, useful in processing text data.
4. **Probabilistic Models in NLP**: Algorithms predicting the likelihood of a particular word following a given sequence of words. This involves calculating probabilities based on language patterns.
5. **Sequence Models**: Models that handle sequential data, relevant for tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence.
6. **Attention Models**: Advanced models that allow for better handling of information in sequences, facilitating the development of state-of-the-art applications such as chatbots, question answering systems, and text summarization.
7. **Neural Machine Translation**: A sophisticated approach to translating text between languages using neural networks.
8. **Summarization**: The process of condensing a large body of text into a shorter, comprehensive summary.
9. **Chatbots**: Systems designed to simulate conversation with human users, often using NLP techniques to understand and generate language.

These concepts will allow you to build and implement various NLP technologies and applications.
