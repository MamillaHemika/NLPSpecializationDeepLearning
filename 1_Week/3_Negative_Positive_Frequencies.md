in the provided text regarding how to generate word counts for logistic regression using sentiment analysis, along with examples to illustrate the concepts.

**1. Generating Counts for Features**

- **Objective**: The goal is to keep track of how often each word appears in texts classified as either positive or negative sentiments. These counts will be essential features for a logistic regression classifier.
- **Feature Extraction**: For each unique word in the vocabulary, you will count:
  - How many times it appears in tweets with a positive sentiment.
  - How many times it appears in tweets with a negative sentiment.
- This process helps create a feature set that can be inputted into the logistic regression model for training.

**2. Visualizing Class Distribution**

- **Imaging Classes**: For sentiment analysis, you can visualize your dataset as consisting of two classes:
  - **Positive Sentiment Class**: A collection of tweets expressing positive sentiment.
  - **Negative Sentiment Class**: A collection of tweets expressing negative sentiment.
- **Example Corpus**: Consider a corpus of four tweets (two positive and two negative):
  - **Positive Tweets**:
        1. “I am happy today!”
        2. “Learning NLP is great and I am excited.”
  - **Negative Tweets**:
        1. “I am not happy with the results.”
        2. “This was a disappointing experience.”

**3. Building the Vocabulary**

- **Unique Words**: From the corpus mentioned, you can create a vocabulary of unique words. For this example, the vocabulary might include:
  - {I, am, happy, today, learning, NLP, great, excited, not, with, the, results, disappointing, experience}.
- In this example, the vocabulary contains 14 unique words.

**4. Calculating Positive Frequencies**

- **Counting Instances**: To get the frequency of words for the positive class, you will need to count how many times each word appears in the positive tweets.
- **Example Table for Positive Frequencies**:
  - The counts for the words might look something like this:

| **Word** | **Positive Frequency** |
| --- | --- |
| I   | 2   |
| am  | 2   |
| happy | 1   |
| today | 1   |
| learning | 1   |
| NLP | 1   |
| great | 1   |
| excited | 1   |

- **Explanation**:
  - The word **"I"** appears twice across both tweets.
  - The word **"am"** also appears twice: once in each tweet.
  - The word **"happy"** appears once in the first positive tweet.

**5. Calculating Negative Frequencies**

- **Counting Instances**: Similarly, for the negative class, count how many times each word appears in the negative tweets.
- **Example Table for Negative Frequencies**:
  - The counts for the words might look something like this:

| **Word** | **Negative Frequency** |
| --- | --- |
| I   | 1   |
| am  | 3   |
| happy | 0   |
| today | 0   |
| learning | 0   |
| NLP | 0   |
| great | 0   |
| excited | 0   |
| not | 1   |
| with | 1   |
| the | 2   |
| results | 1   |
| disappointing | 1   |
| experience | 1   |

- **Explanation**:
  - The word **"am"** appears three times: twice in the first negative tweet and once in the second.
  - Other words, such as **"not"**, appear once, showcasing negative sentiment.
  - The word **"happy"** does not appear in the negative tweets, indicating a clear differentiator for the logistic regression classifier.

**6. Creating a Frequency Dictionary**

- **Dictionary Creation**: In practice, these frequency counts would be stored in a dictionary structure that maps each word and its associated class (positive or negative) to the frequency number.
- **Example Format**: The dictionary could look like:
- frequency_dict = {
- "happy": {"positive": 2, "negative": 0},
- "am": {"positive": 2, "negative": 3},
- "not": {"positive": 0, "negative": 1},
- \# ... and other words
- }

**7. Implications for Logistic Regression**

- The generated counts provide the necessary features for the logistic regression model, enabling it to learn patterns related to positive and negative sentiment based on the occurrence of specific words.
- Each word becomes a feature, and the counts (positive and negative frequencies) serve as indicative statistics that inform the model about the sentiment associated with each word.

**8. Next Steps**

- In the next video, you'd utilize these frequency counts as features for your logistic regression classifier, training the model to categorize new tweets into positive or negative sentiments based on these learned frequencies.

This analysis encapsulates the process of counting word occurrences in sentiment analysis and illustrates the development of a feature set that is crucial for machine learning applications using logistic regression. Each step involved in calculating and organizing word frequencies is essential for creating a robust predictive model.
