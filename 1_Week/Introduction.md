Here are the highlighted points you will learn in the first course of the NLP specialization, along with their definitions:

1. **Classification**: The process of automatically categorizing text into different classes, such as positive or negative sentiment.
2. **Vector Representation of Text**: Learning how to convert text data into numerical vectors, which allows for mathematical operations to be performed on the text.
3. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method used for binary classification tasks, such as determining whether a piece of text has positive or negative sentiment.
4. **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, used for text classification tasks, particularly effective for sentiment analysis.
5. **Vector Space Models**: A model for representing text documents (like tweets, articles, and queries) as vectors in a multi-dimensional space, which is crucial for tasks like information retrieval and indexing.
6. **Information Retrieval**: The process of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources.
7. **Relevancy Ranking**: The method of ranking search results based on how relevant they are to the user's query.
8. **Information Filtering**: Techniques used to filter out unnecessary information and present only relevant data to the user.
9. **Machine Translation**: The process of automatically translating text from one language to another utilizing learned models.
10. **Locality Sensitive Hashing**: A technique for improving the efficiency of nearest neighbor search, which helps in quickly finding similar items in large datasets.

These concepts and techniques will equip you to analyze sentiment in product reviews and create a simple machine translation system.
