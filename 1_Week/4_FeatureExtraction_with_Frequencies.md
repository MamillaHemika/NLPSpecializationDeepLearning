**You previously learned to encode a tweet as a vector of dimension V.**  
This indicates that earlier you learned to represent a tweet using a vector that has multiple dimensions (V can be any number).  
_Example_: If V = 100, a tweet is represented as a vector with 100 features, such as the presence of certain words or sentiment scores.

**2\. You will now learn to encode a tweet or specifically represented as a vector of dimension 3.**  
This line introduces a new method of representing tweets, reducing complexity by using just three dimensions instead of V.  
_Example_: A tweet may now be represented as the vector \[1, 8, 11\], which consists of three specific features.

**3\. In doing so, you'll have a much faster speed for your logistic regression classifier, because instead of learning V features, you only have to learn three features.**  
Reducing the number of dimensions simplifies the model, leading to faster processing times for the logistic regression classifier.  
_Example_: Instead of dealing with 100 features, the classifier now only manages 3, which reduces computation time during training.

**4\. Let's take a look at how you can do this.**  
The author indicates that a detailed explanation or example will follow, showing the process of encoding tweets into the new vector format.  
_Example_: The next sections will explain the three features necessary for the new representation.

**5\. You just saw that the frequency of a word in a class is simply the number of times that the word appears on the set of tweets belonging to that class…**  
This clarifies that word frequency is calculated based on the occurrence of these words in the relevant set of tweets.  
_Example_: If the word "happy" appears 5 times in positive sentiment tweets, its frequency is recorded as 5.

**6\. …and that this table is basically a dictionary mapping from word class pairs, to frequencies, or it just tells us how many times each word showed up in its corresponding class.**  
A dictionary is mentioned, which organizes word frequencies by linking each word with its corresponding sentiment class (e.g., positive or negative).  
_Example_: A dictionary entry may show that "happy" has a frequency of 5 in the positive class and 2 in the negative class.

**7\. Now that you've built your frequencies dictionary, you can use it to extract useful features for sentiment analysis.**  
Having this dictionary enables you to derive features that are significant for determining the sentiment of tweets.  
_Example_: Features like the total number of positive words can aid in classifying the sentiment of a tweet.

**8\. What does a feature look like?**  
A rhetorical question prompts you to contemplate the characteristics or properties that will form the features in the vector representation.  
_Example_: The next few lines will define specific features you will create.

**9\. Let's look at the arbitrary tweet m.**  
The text refers to a specific tweet (tweet 'm') as a subject for feature extraction.  
_Example_: Assume tweet m is: "I feel great not sad."

**10\. The first feature would be a bias unit equal to 1.**  
The first feature in the vector will always be a constant value of 1, serving as a bias term in machine learning models.  
_Example_: This term helps account for the baseline measurement in the classification.

**11\. The second is the sum of the positive frequencies for every unique word on tweet m.**  
This defines the second feature as the total count of positive sentiment words contained in the tweet.  
_Example_: For tweet m, if "great" has a frequency of 3 in the positive class, and this is the only positive word in the tweet, that contributes 3 to the vector.

**12\. The third is the sum of negative frequencies for every unique word on the tweet.**  
The third feature counts the total frequencies of negative sentiment words found in the tweet.  
_Example_: If the word "sad" appears in tweet m and its frequency in the negative class is 2, it contributes 2 to the vector.

**13\. So to extract the features for this representation, you'd only have to sum frequencies of words.**  
Extracting the features simplifies to summing the respective word frequencies based on the established dictionary.  
_Example_: If the positive frequencies total 3 and the negative total 2, you simply sum these values to get the features.

**14\. Easy.**  
This line emphasizes the straightforward nature of the method used to extract features.  
_Example_: It reassures that counting the frequencies to create the feature vector is uncomplicated.

**15\. For instance, take the following tweets.**  
The author prepares to provide example tweets to illustrate the feature extraction method further.  
_Example_: Example tweets that will be analyzed are introduced.

**16\. Now let's look at the frequencies for the positive class from the last lecture.**  
This line references previously obtained information about positive word frequencies from earlier lessons.  
_Example_: Frequencies such as "great" = 3, "excellent" = 4.

**17\. The only words from the vocabulary that don't appear on these tweets are happy and because.**  
This distinction notes which words from a given vocabulary were not found in the tweets.  
_Example_: If "happy" and "because" were expected in the vocabulary but do not show up in the analyzed tweets, this is now clarified.

**18\. Now let's take a look at the second feature from the representation that you saw on the last slide.**  
The text transitions to focus on how to calculate the second feature, maintaining continuity from previous discussions.  
_Example_: The calculation method for the second feature will be detailed next.

**19\. To get this value, you need to sum the frequencies of the words from the vocabulary that appear on the tweet.**  
Describes the process for calculating the second feature based on the words in tweet m.  
_Example_: If "great" = 3 is the only positive word from the tweet, then the sum of frequencies is 3.

**20\. At the end, you get a value equal to eight.**  
This indicates the result of the second feature calculation.  
_Example_: If you combine the positive word frequencies from the tweet and it totals 8, that becomes this feature value.

**21\. Now let's get the value of the third feature.**  
This line signals a shift to obtain the third feature, which is focused on negative word frequencies.  
_Example_: The calculation of negative word frequencies will now be elaborated upon.

**22\. It is the sum of negative frequencies of the words from the vocabulary that appear on the tweet.**  
The third feature relies on summing the negative frequencies associated with the tweet.  
_Example_: If "sad" = 2 and "angry" = 4 from the tweet, the sum will be 6 for the third feature.

**23\. For this example, you should get 11 after summing up the underlined frequencies.**  
Direct instruction on how to perform calculations related to the third feature, providing an expected result.  
_Example_: The total sum of relevant negative word frequencies in this example equals 11.

**24\. So far, this tweets, this representation would be equal to the vector 1, 8, 11.**  
This line summarizes what the final vector representation of the tweet looks like based on previous computations.  
_Example_: The feature vector for tweet m would thus be \[1, 8, 11\].

**25\. You now know how to represent a tweet as a vector of dimension 3.**  
It reaffirms the learner's newfound ability to encode tweets into a simplified three-dimensional vector.  
_Example_: Through this knowledge, you can now efficiently classify sentiments based on tweet vectors.

**26\. In the next video, you will learn to pre-process your tweets and as a result, you will use those pre-processed words as words of your vocabulary.**  
Lastly, the text sets the stage for the next lesson focusing on pre-processing tweets, which is essential for effective vocabulary formation.  
_Example_: This may involve cleaning data or transforming tweets, ensuring better word frequency analysis.

**Feature Extraction with Frequencies**

Given a corpus with positive and negative tweets as follows:

You have to encode each tweet as a vector. Previously, this vector was of dimension V_V_. Now, as you will see in the upcoming videos, you will represent it with a vector of dimension 33. To do so, you have to create a dictionary to map the word, and the class it appeared in (positive or negative) to the number of times that word appeared in its corresponding class.

In the past two videos, we call this dictionary \`freqs\`. In the table above, you can see how words like happy and sad tend to take clear sides, while other words like "I, am" tend to be more neutral. Given this dictionary and the tweet, "I am sad, I am not learning NLP", you can create a vector corresponding to the feature as follows:

To encode the negative feature, you can do the same thing.

Hence you end up getting the following feature vector \[1,8,11\]\[1,8,11\]. 11 corresponds to the bias, 88 the positive feature, and 1111 the negative feature.
