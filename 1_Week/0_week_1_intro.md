Here are the highlighted points you will learn in the first week of Course 1, along with their definitions:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method used for binary classification, particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to its ease of training and reliability in providing baseline results.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as identifying whether tweets convey positive, negative, or neutral feelings.
3. **Data Processing**: The steps taken to clean and prepare the raw text data (in this case, tweets) for analysis, which is essential for building an effective model.
4. **Model Training**: The process of teaching the logistic regression model to recognize patterns in the training data (tweets) to make predictions about sentiment.
5. **Model Testing**: The evaluation of the model's accuracy based on how well it performs on unseen data, allowing you to assess its effectiveness in sentiment classification.

These concepts will help you understand and implement logistic regression for analyzing sentiment in tweets.
